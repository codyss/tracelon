//Brainstorming for Avalon Trace


//Setup
//Set the bad players, good players and Merlin
//Inform bad players of each other
//Inform Merlin of the bad players
//Create board with status
//1. Assign random starter, Lady to left of starter
//Game Play
//2. Player picks people to go on quest
//3. Everyone votes to approve or reject the quest
//4. Tally votes
//5. If quest, those on quest decide wether it is a success or failure (really just the bad player(s) votes)
//    If not quest, track failures up to 5, next turn goes without votes
//6. If one failure, bad win quest, otherwise good win
//7. Repeat Turn
//8. Lady - can ask someone if they are are good or bad - they are informed of that peron's role
//9. Repeat Turn, Lady Until one team has 3 quests
//10. Bad try to guess Merlin
